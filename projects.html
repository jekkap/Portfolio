            <h2>The Rundown</h2>

            <p>
                I created this app for the last project of my javascript class in Fall 2023. 
                This app uses the <a href="https://bymykel.github.io/CSGO-API/" target="_blank">CSGO API</a> 
                to create a random case opening game. When the "Open Case" button is clicked 
                a random number is created and is used to locate a specific weapon skin 
                within the API's files. When the weapon skin is located, the image and name 
                are grabbed and displayed on the screen to show the used what they unboxed. 
                After 3 seconds the image and name fade away and the game resets for another 
                open.
            </p>
            <p>
                In CSGO, these weapon skins are unboxed using keys that can be purchased with 
                real money. The weapon skin that becomes unboxed will also be worth money, 
                however, the weapon skin is usually less than what the case was opened for.
                In each case, there is a rare set of knives that can be unboxed as well which 
                are valued higher than weapon skins. For my game I decided that a random number 
                will be generated between 0-50. If the number that has been generated is 50 
                the user will see a knife displayed, thus making the knife rarer than weapon skins.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned alot about how API's work through this project and how to navtigate 
                through them. My main goal with this project was to figure out a way to create 
                all six cases I used to work on one page rather than making six different HTML 
                documents. This took alot of time for me to figure out but I eventually got 
                it working and im glad I did!
